# Epitech School Projects
<br/>
<p align="center">
Some <a href="http://www.epitech.eu">Epitech</a> school projects made in 2021/2024.
<br/>
These projects are school projects, these projects are made in <strong>8 days of work</strong>, except the year-end projects which are made <strong>over 1 year</strong>.
<br/>
In addition, during my internship, I worked with Java Spring Boot and VueJS.

## Table of Contents 
All the table is ordered by the latest date (descending order).
<br/>
To access the projects, look at the folders in this repository. The project names in the table of contents refer to the folder names.

The contents in the table of contents are my best projects during my studies from the newest to the oldest.

- Year-end project - second version: **NextJS projects**
    - Trackfinder is a web app with the goal of giving the possibility to share and display some hiring opportunities.
    - The year-end project aims to build a custom project, from creation to deployment: refer to 
    [trackfinder-neon.vercel.app](https://trackfinder-neon.vercel.app/)
    - This second version is due to the complexity of integrating a custom pathfinding algorithm made in Python
- Year-end project - PathFinder of European Maps: **Python, NextJS**
    - This first version is not fully made in NextJS. All the pathfinding algorithms and the API are made in Python.
    - The algorithms use some points stored in a PostgreSQL database. These points represent 50 square meters of the European maps. All these nodes are used to find the best route.
    - The API is made in Flask.
- Kafka projects: **Spring Boot, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Selenium**
    - A web application that uses Selenium to scrape some Crypto Data.
    - This crypto data is sent to a Kafka broker and processed to be saved in a database.
    - This crypto data is then displayed on a React web app.
    - All the work is launchable from a **docker-compose file** except the frontend, which is run with the Node engine.
- Pathfinding AI: **Python**
    - A project to learn how to create AI (artificial intelligence) using reinforcement learning. The idea is to train an intelligence model. The model will be trained over a certain period. When it performs a good action (e.g., it goes in the right direction), it gets a bonus (+1 reward). When it performs a wrong action (e.g., it walks away), it gets a penalty and a malus.
- Predict lung pneumonia with AI: **Python**
    - An artificial intelligence will be trained to detect if a lung scan is sick or not.
- Google Photos-like Android app: **Java, Kotlin**
    - An Android application made to compress pictures by a given percentage. These pictures, whether compressed or not, can be saved or edited in an interface, and shared with friends or a group of friends.
- Time Manager: **Phoenix Elixir, VueJS**
    - A web application used to manage a community of people. The idea is to save "how much time we've worked today." For example, when we start working, we launch a timer, and when we stop, we click it off again. 
    - The difference in time is calculated to determine how much time a person has worked.
    - A system of charts is used to display statistics about the employees' working time.
- End-to-end pathfinding solution: **Python**
    - A pathfinding solution used to give the best path between two points.
    - More than just walking trips, the solution provides alternatives with subway, train, bus, etc., based on Google API.
- Discord-like app: **Express, ReactJS, WebSocket**
    - A live web chat similar to the Discord app. WebSocket is used to quickly update the interface (e.g., when a new message is received, it is displayed immediately).
- Crypto web app: **ReactJS, Spring Boot**
    - Spring Boot will grab some Crypto Data from a public API and save it in a database. This data is shared through the ReactJS web app.
    - **A second crypto application using Spring Boot is available.**
    - **And one more in Angular and Express...**
- CI/CD pipeline: **Ansible, Docker**
    - More like a POC (Proof Of Concept), this project is used to deploy an application, and a GitLab pipeline is used to verify if the tests passed. If they pass, it triggers the deployment.
- Job offer website: **NodeJS Express**
    - This is my first project made during my EPITECH years. It's a job offer website. Employers can publish job offers, and candidates can apply to them.

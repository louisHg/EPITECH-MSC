<br/>
The contents in the table of contents is my bests projects during my studies

- Year end project - second versions : **NextJS projects**
    - Trackfinder is a web app with for goal to give the possibility to share and display some hiring.
    - The year end project has for objective to build a custom projets, from the creation to the deployement : ref to 
    [trackfinder-neon.vercel.app](https://trackfinder-neon.vercel.app/)
    - This seconds versions is due to the complexity to integrate a custom pathfinding make in Python
- Year end project - PathFinder of European Maps : **Python, NextJS**
    - This first versions is not fully make in NextJS, All the Algorithm of pathfinding and the API are make in Python
    - The algorithms used some points stored in PostgreSQL database, theses points represents 50 square meters points of the Europeean maps. All theses nodes are used to find the best road 
    - The API is make in Flask
- Kafka projects : **Spring boot, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Selenium**
    - A web application which used Selenium to scrapping some Crypto Data
    - This crypto are send to a broker Kafka and interpreted to be saved in database
    - This crypto data picked are now duplicated on a React web app
    - All the work are launchable from a **docker-compose file** excepts the from which is run with node engine
- Pathfinding AI : **Python**
    - Projects to learn how to make AI(artificial intelligence) by reiforcement, the idea to train a model of intelligence. The model will be trainning during a certain time. When he did a good actions (example, he go to the good direction), he gets a bonus (+ 1 reward). When he did a wrong actions (For instance, he walks aways), we gave him a penalties and a malus
- Predict lung pneumonia with AI: **Python**
    - An artificial intelligence will be train to detects if a scanning of a lung is sick or not. 
- Such like Google Photo Android: **Java, Kotlin**
    - Android application made to compress his pictures from a percentage given. These pictures compress or not should saved or edit in a interface, plus we can share to a friend or a group of friends.
- Time Manager: **Phoenix elixir, VueJS**
    - Web application used to handling a community of persons, the idea is to saved "how much time we've working today". As example, imagine when we're going to work we launch a chrono and we leave it we click off again. 
    The differences between it will calculate how much time a salary has working
    - A system of charts is used to display some statistics about the salarie's working time.
- Job offer web site : **NodeJS Express**
    - This is my first projects make during my EPITECH years, it's a job offer website. We can publish some job offer if we're an employers, and applies to it if we're a candidate
- End to end pathfinding solution: **Python**
    - A pathfing solutions use to give the best path between 2 points. 
    - More than foot trips, the solution gives alternative with subway, trainline, bus etc... based on google API
- Discord like: **Express, ReactJS, Web socket**
    - Live web chat like Discord app. The web socket is used to update quickly the render (when we got a new message display it as well)
- Crypto web app: **ReactJS, Spring Boot**
    - Spring boot will grab some CryptoData from public API, saved it a database. This data are shared throw the ReactJS web app.
    - **A second crypto application using Spring boot is available**
    - **And 1 more in Angular and Express...**
- CI CD pipeline: **Ansible, Docker**
    - More like a POC(Proof Of Concepts), this projects is used to deploy an application and a pipeline gitlab is used to verify if the test passed. If it's the fact it triggers the deployement

To launch the application in an emulator, first of all download, install and setup Android Studio and
an image of the phone you'll be using.

Open the folder with contain the project in a terminal and run the following command:
npx react-native run-android

Then launch Android Studio and search for your folder with the project, and choose the folder named "android" that's in it.

You can then start the phone in the emulator and open the application.
